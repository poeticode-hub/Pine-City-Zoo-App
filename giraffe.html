                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                            <p>Giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) are the tallest land animals, known for their long necks and legs.
                                They are native to Africa and are easily recognized by their distinctive coat patterns, which consist of irregular brown patches separated by lighter-colored fur. 
                                Giraffes are herbivores and primarily feed on leaves, fruits, and flowers from trees and shrubs. 
                                They have a unique way of walking, moving both legs on one side of their body and then the other, which gives them a distinctive gait.
