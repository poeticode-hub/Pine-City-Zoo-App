                            <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                            <p>Gorillas (Gorilla spp.) are the largest primates and are native to the forests of central Africa. 
                                They are known for their strong build, with broad chests and long arms. 
                                Gorillas are primarily herbivores, feeding on leaves, stems, fruit, and flowers.
                                They live in groups called troops, led by a dominant male known as a silverback.
