                            <h3>LION</h3>
                            <p>Lions (Panthera leo) are large carnivorous mammals that are native to Africa and parts of Asia. 
                                They are known for their powerful build, with males possessing a distinctive mane. 
                                Lions are social animals, living in groups called prides, which are typically made up of related females and their offspring, along with a small number of adult males.
                            </p>
                            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the lion at pen G15, near the savannah habitat zone.</p>
                            <strong><p>WHAT DO THEY EAT?</p></strong>
                            <p>Lions are carnivores and primarily feed on large ungulates, such as zebras and wildebeests. 
                                They are known to hunt in groups, using teamwork to take down their prey.
