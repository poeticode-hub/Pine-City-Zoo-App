                            <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
                              <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two 
                                 species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana)
                                 and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). Male African
                                 elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of
                                 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).
                                 All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long
                                 trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting
                                 water and grasping objects. Their pillar-like legs can carry 
                                 their great weight. </p>
                              <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                              <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
                              <strong><p>WHAT DO THEY EAT?</p></strong>
                              <p>Elephants are herbivores and primarily feed on grasses, leaves, fruits, and bark. 
                                 They are known to consume large quantities of food each day, often exceeding 150 kg (330 lb).</p>
