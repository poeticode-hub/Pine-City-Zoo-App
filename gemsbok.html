                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                            <p>Gemsbok (Oryx gazella) are large antelopes that are native to the arid regions of southern Africa. 
                                They are known for their striking appearance, with long, straight horns and a distinctive black and white facial pattern. 
                                Gemsbok are well adapted to their harsh environment, able to survive for long periods without water by obtaining moisture from the vegetation they eat.
                                Males and females both have horns which can grow up to 85 cm long.
                            </p>
                            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen G18, near the desert habitat zone.</p>
                            <strong><p>WHAT DO THEY EAT?</p></strong>
                            <p>Gemsbok are herbivores and primarily feed on grasses, leaves, and shrubs. 
                                They are known to graze on a variety of vegetation, including acacia trees and other desert plants.
